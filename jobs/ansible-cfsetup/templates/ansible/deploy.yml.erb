# All variables are defined in the inventory (or group_vars), so you can test
# this playbook offline with a fake inventory, or reuse in other places

# This playbook was created to run as errand by ansible-deploy job
# available in ansible release, so it will only be triggered by that action.
# The idea is setup/deploy all the nodes statically defined instead of
# run each time one node is being added.
