# You can add here more CF environments, they are just names!
# and for each enviroment you can override the variables
# defined in `group_vars/cf.yml` by creating a new file
# with the same name. The manifest `group_vars/cf.yml` it will be 
# applied as a default variables (for example for feature flags,
# environment variables, etc) for all children like this one,
# and then by having a file with the same name as the children
# (`group_vars/test.yml` in this example) overwrite the variable
# `cf_orgs` and define specific organizations for this CF.
